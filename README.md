# Ima

A macOS task manager centered on decay and impermanence, not long-term planning.

## Philosophy

Ima is designed around the concept that not everything needs to be preserved forever. Tasks have fixed expiration times, and when they expire, they disappear permanently—no archives, no recovery, no second chances.

## Core Features

### Task Management
- **Fixed Expiration**: Every task has a maximum duration (capped at 7 days by default)
- **Permanent Deletion**: Expired tasks disappear forever
- **Urgency-Based Display**: Tasks are sorted by time remaining
- **Dominant Task View**: The most urgent task gets prominent visual treatment

### Menu Bar Integration
- **Quick Status**: See active task count and next expiration
- **Fast Access**: Add tasks and open the app from the menu bar
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick actions with standard macOS shortcuts

## Philosophy in Practice

Ima encourages you to:
- Focus on what's immediately actionable
- Accept that some things will expire
- Develop better judgment about what truly matters
- Experience time as finite and irreversible

The app rewards finishing tasks before they expire and quietly punishes neglect through the dimming fire indicator—a non-verbal signal of your relationship with time and commitment.
